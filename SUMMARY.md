# SteadywellOS Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

SteadywellOS is a comprehensive palliative care coordination platform designed to streamline nurse check-ins, protocol automation, and patient management through telephone interactions. The platform uses AI-assisted protocol guidance and integrates telephony capabilities for patient assessment and follow-up.

## Implemented Components

### Core Architecture

1. **Project Structure**
   - Flask-based backend with modular organization
   - Database models for users, patients, protocols, assessments, calls, and more
   - RESTful API with JSON schema validation
   - Frontend templates with Bootstrap 5

2. **Authentication & Security**
   - JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Audit logging for HIPAA compliance
   - Secure API endpoints with proper permission checks

3. **Database Design**
   - PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
   - Models for patients, protocols, assessments, calls, medications
   - Relationships between entities for data integrity

### Clinical Protocol Implementation

1. **Protocol Structure**
   - JSON-based protocol definitions with structured questions
   - Decision tree logic for symptom assessment
   - Intervention recommendations based on severity thresholds

2. **Specialized Protocols**
   - Cancer protocol with pain, nausea, and fatigue assessment
   - Heart failure protocol with dyspnea and edema evaluation
   - COPD protocol with respiratory symptom management

### API Implementation

1. **Core Endpoints**
   - Authentication endpoints (login, refresh, logout)
   - User management endpoints
   - Patient management endpoints
   - Protocol, assessment, and call endpoints
   - Dashboard data endpoints

2. **API Documentation**
   - Comprehensive API documentation with examples
   - Schema validation for request/response data

### AI Integration

1. **RAG Model Service**
   - Anthropic Claude integration for protocol guidance
   - Assessment analysis for intervention recommendations
   - Call script generation for telephony interactions
   - Transcript analysis for clinical documentation

### Telephony Features

1. **Twilio Integration**
   - Outbound call initiation
   - TwiML generation for interactive voice responses
   - Call recording and transcription
   - Call status tracking and management

### Frontend Components

1. **User Interface**
   - Dashboard with metrics and upcoming tasks
   - Patient management screens
   - Call management interface
   - Assessment forms with symptom rating scales
   - Protocol-specific views

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Bootstrap 5-based responsive layout
   - Mobile-friendly interfaces for clinical use

### Deployment Configuration

1. **Containerization**
   - Docker configuration for application components
   - Docker Compose for local development and testing
   - Production-ready container configuration

2. **AWS Deployment**
   - Documentation for deploying to AWS ECS
   - Security considerations for cloud deployment

## Additional Features

1. **Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive audit trail for HIPAA compliance
   - Tracking of all patient data access

2. **Real-time Notifications**
   - Setup for upcoming call notifications
   - Follow-up reminders for urgent patient needs

3. **Documentation**
   - Setup and installation guides
   - API documentation
   - Protocol implementation details
