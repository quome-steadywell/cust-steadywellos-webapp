# SteadywellOS - Palliative Care Coordination Platform

SteadywellOS is a comprehensive platform designed for palliative care coordination and remote patient management. It enables healthcare providers to efficiently manage patient assessments, schedule follow-up calls, and implement specialized care protocols for conditions like cancer, heart failure, and COPD.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

SteadywellOS can be set up and run using the Just command runner or directly using the shell scripts in the `scripts` directory.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation) (optional but recommended)

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
# Using Just (recommended)
just install

# Or using the script directly
./scripts/install.sh
```

This will:
- Check prerequisites (Docker, Docker Compose)
- Set up necessary environment files
- Configure required permissions

#### Step 2: Start the application

```bash
# Using Just (recommended)
just up

# Or using the script directly
./scripts/up.sh
```

This will:
- Build and start all necessary containers
- Configure the application environment
- Make the application available at http://localhost:8080

#### Step 3: Initialize and seed the database

The database is automatically initialized during startup, but you can also do it manually:

```bash
# Using Just
just db-init   # Initialize database schema
just db-seed   # Seed with sample data

# Or using scripts directly
./scripts/db_init.sh
./scripts/db_seed.sh
```

After completing these steps, the platform will be available at http://localhost:8080

## Default Login Credentials

The system is seeded with the following test users:

- **Admin**
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `password123`

- **Nurse**
  - Username: `nurse1`
  - Password: `password123`

- **Physician**
  - Username: `physician`
  - Password: `password123`

**IMPORTANT:** These are default test credentials. In a production environment, you must change these passwords.

## ðŸ§° Available Commands

The following commands are available through the Just command runner:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just up` | Start the application |
| `just down` | Stop the application |
| `just restart` | Restart the application |
| `just logs` | View application logs |
| `just db-init` | Initialize the database schema |
| `just db-seed` | Seed the database with sample data |
| `just db-reset` | Reset the database (drop, create, seed) |
| `just protocols [type]` | Initialize protocols (type: cancer, heart_failure, copd, or all) |
| `just status` | Check application status |
| `just test` | Run tests |
| `just install` | Install dependencies |

### Protocol Initialization

The system includes specialized care protocols for different conditions:

```bash
# Initialize all protocol types
just protocols

# Initialize a specific protocol type
just protocols cancer
just protocols heart_failure
just protocols copd
```

Each protocol includes:
- Structured assessment questions
- Recommended interventions based on symptoms
- Decision tree logic for determining appropriate care actions

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Role-based access control with secure login for healthcare providers
- **Protocol-Based Care**: Specialized protocols for cancer, heart failure, and COPD patients
- **Telephony Integration**: Automated calls, voice assessments, and transcription via Twilio
- **AI-Powered Guidance**: Uses RAG models to analyze patient information and suggest interventions
- **HIPAA-Compliant**: Secure handling of sensitive patient data with audit logging
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Real-time overview of patient status and upcoming tasks

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10 with Flask framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap 5
- **API**: RESTful API with JWT authentication
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude for protocol guidance
- **Telephony**: Twilio API for voice calls and transcription
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables to configure:

- `FLASK_APP`: Set to `run.py`
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `development` or `production`
- `SECRET_KEY`: Application secret key for security
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: API key for Claude AI integration
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Twilio account SID for telephony
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Twilio authentication token
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Twilio phone number for outgoing calls

## API Documentation

The application provides a RESTful API with the following main endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Authenticate and receive JWT token
- `GET /api/v1/patients`: List all patients
- `GET /api/v1/patients/:id`: Get patient details
- `POST /api/v1/calls`: Schedule a new call
- `POST /api/v1/assessments`: Create a new patient assessment

Refer to the full API documentation in the `/docs` directory.

## Protocols

SteadywellOS comes with three specialized protocols:

1. **Cancer Palliative Care Protocol**: Pain management, nausea control, and fatigue assessments
2. **Heart Failure Protocol**: Dyspnea, edema, and activity tolerance evaluations
3. **COPD Protocol**: Respiratory symptoms, oxygen use, and breathing technique assessments

Each protocol includes:
- Structured question sets for telephone assessments
- Severity rating systems for symptoms
- Decision tree algorithms for intervention recommendations
- Educational materials for patients and caregivers

## Development

To modify the platform:

1. Stop the containers: `docker-compose down`
2. Make your changes
3. Rebuild and restart: `docker-compose up -d --build`
