# SteadywellOS Improvements Documentation

This document tracks improvements made to the SteadywellOS platform as part of the tasks outlined in `tasks.md`.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Consistent Error Handling Across API Endpoints

**Date Completed**: [Current Date]

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced the existing error handling utility in `app/utils/error_handlers.py`
- Added comprehensive logging for all error types
- Implemented appropriate log levels based on error severity:
  - INFO for client errors (400-level)
  - WARNING for authentication/authorization errors
  - ERROR for server-side errors (500-level)
- Added detailed context information to error logs

**Impact**:
- Improved debugging capabilities through consistent error logging
- Enhanced error tracking and monitoring
- Better visibility into application issues
- Consistent error response format for API consumers

### 2. Consistent Logging Strategy

**Date Completed**: [Current Date]

**Changes Made**:
- Created a new logging utility module in `app/utils/logger.py`
- Implemented structured JSON logging for better searchability
- Added request context information to logs (URL, method, IP, user ID)
- Configured log rotation to prevent log file growth issues
- Added environment variable configuration for log level and format
- Integrated logging with Flask application in `app/__init__.py`

**Impact**:
- Standardized logging format across the application
- Improved log searchability and analysis
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Better visibility into application behavior
- Proper log rotation for production environments
- Configurable logging levels for different environments

## Next Steps

The following improvements are recommended for future work:

1. **Refactor duplicate code in API endpoints**
   - Extract common authentication and permission checking logic
   - Create reusable utility functions for common operations

2. **Add comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase**
   - Add type annotations to all function parameters and return values
   - Use mypy for static type checking

3. **Improve code documentation**
   - Add docstrings to all classes and methods
   - Document complex algorithms and business logic
